# Arska
Arska makes your energy purchases greener and saves on your energy bill by demand-side flexibility, i.e. maximising usage of self produced (solar) energy and shifting energy purchase to cheapest and lower carbon intensive hours.

Arska is a microcontroller (ESP32, limited functionality with ESP8266) based application for managing energy consumption. It can switch on and of loads  based on measured consumption and production information as well as price and renevable energy forecast. Arska gets preprocessed market and energy forecast data from Arska Server (optional).
