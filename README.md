# Arska
Arska makes your energy purchases greener and saves on your energy bill by demand-side flexibility, i.e. maximising usage of self produced (solar) energy and shifting energy purchase to cheapest and lower carbon intensive hours.

Arska is a ESP32 microcontroller based application for managing energy consumption. It can switch on and of loads based on measured consumption and production information as well as price and solar energy forecast. 

Arska can control various electric switches connected to e.g. water heater and car chargers. It can also privide potential-free signal for temperature control for example to heat-pumps. Arska controls devices based on following data:
- Day-ahead electricity price per hour from [EntsoE](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/) .
